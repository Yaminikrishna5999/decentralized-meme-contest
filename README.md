# MemeContestV2 Smart Contract

## Project Description

MemeContestV2 is a decentralized meme competition platform built on the Aptos blockchain that enables community-driven meme contests with built-in voting mechanisms and prize distribution. The smart contract facilitates fair and transparent meme competitions where participants can submit their memes by paying a small fee, vote for their favorite submissions, and compete for prizes from a dynamically growing prize pool.

The platform operates on a simple yet effective model: participants pay a submission fee to enter their memes into the contest, which simultaneously adds to the total prize pool and grants them voting rights for existing submissions. This creates an engaging ecosystem where the community directly contributes to and benefits from the contest's success.
